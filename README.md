# A cross-border catalogue of Public Services with Finland and Estonia
A cross-border catalogue of public services, i.e. a catalogue of public services at European level. Public service descriptions from Estonia and Finland are harvested, transformed and displayed on a user-friendly webpage

## Introduction
Citizens and businesses from Estonia and Finland face a number of **challenges** both at national and European level when trying to find information on the public services available to them:

There are different portals for finding public service descriptions and the information is offered in different languages;
The descriptions do not follow a common structure, and,
No portal provides a comprehensive overview of all the public services available across Europe.
In addition, public administrations need to develop solutions that allow them to publish user-centric **public service descriptions** for citizens and businesses on a national and European level.

Finland and Estonia have a great deal of cross-border movement of citizens and business for economic, social and cultural reasons. Therefore, these countries **need to exchange large amounts of information** across borders, public services being a perfect example.

The pilot can be accessed [here](http://cpsv-ap.semic.eu/cpsv-ap_harvester_xBorder_pilot/).

## Functional description

We designed a pilot to implement a **user-centric portal** where public service descriptions from both countries are available in a harmonised and user-friendly format. To achieve this, we conducted a mapping between the CPSV-AP and the Estonian and Finnish data models (FSC). The information required for the central portal is stored in different national portals in each country. That information was harvested, transformed to the CPSV-AP and published in a user-centric fashion by using the CPSV-AP as a common vocabulary between the data models. The figure below provides an overview of the process.
